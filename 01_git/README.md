# Exercise 1: GIT

In the tutorials for the humanoid robots course, we will use the source
control system GIT for distributing the exercises and for handing in the 
solutions.


* Official homepage: http://git-scm.com/
* Beginner tutorial: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
* Advanced tutorials: https://de.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
* Tortoise GIT (a popular GIT client for Microsoft Windows): https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
* GIT is available in all Linux package managers and can be used directly from the console
* There are many graphical user frontends for all operating systems and 
most development environments (Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.) directly support GIT


1. Make yourself familiar with GIT. You should be able to use at least
the basic GIT commands `git init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.
2. Clone your personal GIT repository. We will send you the URL and
account credentials when you register for the tutorials via e-mail.
3. Add a new file `01_git/hello.txt` with the content *hello world*.
4. Commit and push your changes to the GIT server. The server will 
automatically build your package, test the code, and write the output to
the Wiki of your GIT repository. This process will take a few seconds to
complete. 
5. Check the results of this exercise in your project's Wiki at
