function getClosestNodeInList:

Instead of setting the distance variable initially to a big number 10000, you can set it to infifnity; this will be more generic:

double dist = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

function getNeighbors:

Instead of that, you can just loop directly with dx:-1->1 and dy:-1->1 and then check inside the loop for all the necessary conditions.

for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; ++dx)                                            
	for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; ++dy)


function addNearestNeighbor:

Instead of recomputing the distance to get closest neighbor, you can make use of getClosestNodeInList to get closest node in the list of neighbors.

Also, you forgot to check that the closest neighbor is not NULL:

if (minNode != NULL)
