* function: isLinearIndependent
use a for loop instead of assigning the A matrix elements one-by-one. 
Hint: you will need to use a.size().

* function: solveLinearSystem
 it is correct, however it is better to solve it using fullPivLu()
 instead of colPivHouseholderQr(). fullPivLu() is more accurate.
