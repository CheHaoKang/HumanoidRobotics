function  oneSampleZTest:

In the case of two-tailed (equal and different), you did not set the left and right boundries correct (however, it just could pass the test case by luck). It should be:

double left_boundry = (1-confidenceLevel)/2;
double right_boundry = 1-left_boundry;

Because the probablity of (1-confidenceLevel) is divided in this case between the two tails of the distribution.


function oneSampleTTest:

The condition of the At_Least case is wrong. It should be:

if (tscore < -tlookup )
