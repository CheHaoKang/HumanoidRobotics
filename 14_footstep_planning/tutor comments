function executeFootstep:

The equations of x and y are wrong, these are the correct 

x = currentFootstep->x + cos(currentFootstep->theta) * action.dx + sin(currentFootstep->theta) * action.dy;  
y = currentFootstep->y - sin(currentFootstep->theta) * action.dx + cos(currentFootstep->theta) * action.dy;
